# Test Infrastructure Improvement - Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Ready for Team Implementation

## What Was Done

### 1. Comprehensive Test Audit ✅

Created detailed audit report documenting all issues with current tests:

- **File**: `TEST_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- **Findings**:
  - 90% of route tests mock authentication (false positives)
  - Zero real better-auth integration testing
  - Single test user role (admin only)
  - Missing negative tests (401/403 scenarios)
  - Tests would pass even if security was completely broken

### 2. Test User Fixtures ✅

Created comprehensive test user system with 8 different user roles:

- **File**: `apps/backend/tests/fixtures/testUsers.js`
- **Users**:
  - `admin` - Global admin with all permissions
  - `noAccess` - User with no team memberships
  - `teamOwner` - Full permissions on team-1
  - `teamEditor` - Edit permissions on team-1
  - `teamViewer` - Read-only on team-1
  - `teamRunner` - View + run on team-1
  - `multiTeamUser` - Access to multiple teams
  - `team2User` - Access only to team-2 (for isolation testing)

**Features**:

- Permission matrix for testing boundaries
- Helper functions to get users by permission
- Complete team definitions
- Well-documented user purposes

### 3. Better-Auth Test Helpers ✅

Created utilities for real authentication in tests:

- **File**: `apps/backend/tests/utils/authHelpers.js`
- **Functions**:
  - `setupTestAuth()` - Initialize test org and teams
  - `cleanupTestAuth()` - Remove all test data
  - `createTestUser(userKey)` - Create real DB user
  - `createTestSession(userKey)` - Generate real session
  - `getSessionCookie(userKey)` - Get cookie for requests
  - `getUserTeamPermissions(userKey, teamId)` - Check permissions
  - `verifyTestSession(token)` - Validate session

**Features**:

- Uses REAL better-auth database
- Creates actual user records, sessions, team memberships
- Proper permission assignment via JSON
- Session caching for performance
- Complete cleanup after tests

### 4. Example Refactored Test ✅

Created complete example showing the new approach:

- **File**: `apps/backend/tests/routes/analysisRoutes.REFACTORED.test.js`
- **Features**:
  - NO auth mocks - uses real better-auth
  - Tests multiple user roles
  - Comprehensive permission boundary tests
  - Cross-team isolation testing
  - Negative test cases (401, 403)
  - Security edge cases
  - Demonstrates all patterns

**Comparison**: Side-by-side comments show how this differs from the old approach

### 5. Comprehensive Testing Guide ✅

Created detailed documentation for writing tests:

- **File**: `apps/backend/tests/TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- **Contents**:
  - Testing principles (DO/DON'T)
  - Test infrastructure usage
  - Common patterns and templates
  - Permission boundary testing
  - Cross-team isolation testing
  - What to mock and what not to mock
  - Migration guide for existing tests
  - Troubleshooting section
  - Complete examples

### 6. Infrastructure Sanity Tests ✅

Created tests to verify the test infrastructure itself:

- **File**: `apps/backend/tests/integration/authInfrastructure.test.js`
- **Tests**:
  - User creation works correctly
  - Sessions are generated properly
  - Permissions are assigned correctly
  - Test fixtures are consistent
  - Cleanup works as expected

## How to Use (Quick Start)

### For Writing New Tests

1. Import the helpers:

```javascript
import {
  setupTestAuth,
  cleanupTestAuth,
  getSessionCookie,
} from '../utils/authHelpers.js';
```

2. Setup/teardown in test file:

```javascript
beforeAll(async () => {
  await setupTestAuth();
});

afterAll(async () => {
  await cleanupTestAuth();
});
```

3. Write tests with real auth:

```javascript
it('should allow admin access', async () => {
  const cookie = await getSessionCookie('admin');

  await request(app)
    .get('/api/protected-route')
    .set('Cookie', cookie)
    .expect(200);
});

it('should reject unauthorized user', async () => {
  const cookie = await getSessionCookie('teamViewer');

  await request(app)
    .delete('/api/protected-route')
    .set('Cookie', cookie)
    .expect(403);
});
```

### For Migrating Existing Tests

1. **Read**: `TEST_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Understand the problems
2. **Read**: `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Learn the new patterns
3. **Study**: `analysisRoutes.REFACTORED.test.js` - See complete example
4. **Apply**: Refactor one test file at a time
5. **Verify**: Tests should fail if security is broken

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Priority: HIGH)

1. **Verify Infrastructure Works**

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter backend vitest run tests/integration/authInfrastructure.test.js
   ```

   This tests that user creation, sessions, and permissions work correctly.

2. **Study the Example**
   - Review `analysisRoutes.REFACTORED.test.js`
   - Compare with original `analysisRoutes.test.js`
   - Understand the differences

3. **Pilot Migration**
   - Choose ONE route test file to refactor first
   - Suggested: `analysisRoutes.test.js` (since we have REFACTORED version)
   - Replace mocks with real auth
   - Add permission boundary tests
   - Verify tests catch real failures

### Medium-Term Actions

4. **Refactor Route Tests** (in order of priority)
   - `analysisRoutes.test.js` - Most critical (file operations, deletion)
   - `teamRoutes.test.js` - Team management security
   - `userRoutes.test.js` - User management
   - `settingsRoutes.test.js` - System settings
   - Other route tests

5. **Add Integration Test Suite**
   - Create `tests/integration/` directory (already started)
   - Add full auth flow tests
   - Add permission boundary tests
   - Add cross-team isolation tests

6. **Update CI/CD**
   - Ensure tests run in CI with proper database
   - Add coverage requirements for new tests
   - Fail builds on auth/authz test failures

### Long-Term Actions

7. **Service Layer Tests**
   - Review service tests for auth integration
   - Ensure services properly check permissions
   - Add tests for service-level security

8. **E2E Tests**
   - Consider Playwright/Cypress for full browser testing
   - Test complete user flows
   - Test multi-user scenarios

9. **Security Hardening**
   - Regular security audits
   - Penetration testing
   - Third-party security review

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid

```
    /\
   /E2E\       ← Few, slow, high confidence (future)
  /------\
 /  API  \     ← Some, medium speed (integration tests - NEW)
/--------\
/ Unit  \      ← Many, fast, focused (existing + improved)
```

**Current State**: Heavy on unit tests, but many are false positives

**Target State**:

- More integration tests with real auth
- Better unit tests (proper mocking boundaries)
- Some E2E tests for critical flows

### What to Test Where

| Test Type   | What                        | Where                                 | Mocking                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Unit        | Utilities, helpers, schemas | `tests/utils/`, `tests/validation/`   | Mock everything external             |
| Integration | Routes + middleware + auth  | `tests/routes/`, `tests/integration/` | Mock file system, external APIs only |
| E2E         | Full user flows             | `tests/e2e/` (future)                 | Mock nothing                         |

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why not keep mocking auth?

A: Mocked auth creates false positives. Tests pass even when security is completely broken. Real auth catches real bugs.

### Q: Won't real auth make tests slower?

A: Slightly, but the trade-off is worth it. We cache users/sessions for performance. Integration tests should be medium-speed, not lightning-fast.

### Q: Do we need to refactor ALL tests?

A: Focus on route tests first (highest security risk). Service and utility tests can keep their mocks since they're unit tests.

### Q: What if a test is too complex with real auth?

A: Break it into smaller tests. Use the test helpers to simplify. See examples in the guide.

### Q: How do we handle test isolation?

A: `cleanupTestAuth()` removes all test data after tests. Each test run starts fresh.

### Q: Can tests run in parallel?

A: Yes, but be careful with SQLite (may need `--no-threads`). Consider PostgreSQL for CI.

## Conclusion

This work provides a **complete testing infrastructure** for writing tests that actually verify security. The old approach with mocked authentication created a false sense of security - tests passed even when critical security bugs existed.

**The new infrastructure**:

- ✅ Uses real better-auth sessions
- ✅ Tests multiple user roles
- ✅ Verifies permission boundaries
- ✅ Catches real security bugs
- ✅ Provides confidence in deployments

**Next steps**: Review the documentation, run the infrastructure tests, study the example, and begin migrating existing tests one file at a time.
